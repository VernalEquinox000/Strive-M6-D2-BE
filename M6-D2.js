     MEDIUM PROJECT


     Your wonderful TAs have created a frontend clone of the famous Medium application. You can find it here --> https://github.com/ubeytdemirr/medium-template
     In every page's folder you should find some guidelines to properly use this frontend
     
     Your task is to build a proper backend being able to communicate with it. Backend needs to grant data persistance via MongoDB

     //BACKEND

     Your backend should have the following routes included:

     GET /articles => returns the list of articles
     GET /articles/:id => returns a single article
     POST /articles => create a new article
     PUT /articles/:id => edit the article with the given id
     DELETE /articles/:id => delete the article with the given id

     Article:
     
         {
             "_id": "string", // server generated
             "headLine": "string",
             "subHead": "string",
             "content": "string",
             "category": "string",
             "author": {
                 "name": "string",
                 "img": "string"
             },
             "cover": "string",
             "createdAt": Date, // server generated
             "updatedAt": Date // server generated
         }
